You can of course include steps made above (ideally, the above questions informed your system design!), but your model should not be literally identical to any of the above models. Other ideas: retrofitting, autoencoders, GloVe, subword modeling, ... \n",

    "1. Your code must operate on one of the count matrices in `data/vsmdata`. You can choose which one. __Other pretrained vectors cannot be introduced__.\n",

    "1. Your code must be self-contained, so that we can work with your model directly in your homework submission notebook. If your model depends on external data or other resources, please submit a ZIP archive containing these resources along with your submission.\n",

    "In the cell below, please provide a brief technical description of your original system, so that the teaching team can gain an understanding of what it does. This will help us to understand your code and analyze all the submissions to identify patterns and strategies."
